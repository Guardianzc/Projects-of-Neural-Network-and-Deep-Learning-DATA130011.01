# Projects-of-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning-DATA130011.01
This is a report including all projects in my 2021 Spring Neural Network and Deep Learning course (DATA130011.01) in [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/)  of [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) .
The project is mainly about the construction of neural networks.
## Project
   * [Lab1_Warmup](./Lab1)
   * [Project1_Handwritten digit classification](./Project1)
   * [Project2_CIFAR-10](./Project2)
   * [Project4_Cars](./Project4_Cars)
   * [FinalProject_GOMOKU](./FinalProject_GOMOKU)
   
## Details
**Lab1_Warmup**
* This lab aims to help the students refresh the basics of python, particularly, NumPy
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Lab1/Lab1.pdf) and my report [here](./Lab1/Report.pdf)
    
**Project1_Handwritten digit classification**
* In this project, we use MATLAB to achieve the basic methods and settings in neural network
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project1/project_1.pdf) and my report [here](./Project1/Report_钟诚_16307110259.pdf)

**Project2_CIFAR-10**
* Network needs to contain a lot of components. (e.g. 2D pooling layer, Drop out, Residual Connection) So it will improve the performance of the network on the CIFAR-10 dataset based on the ResNet-18 network.
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project3_Blackjack/index.html) and my report [here](./Project3_Blackjack/Report.pdf)
    
**Project4_Cars**
* This project is a modified version of the Driverless Car assignment written by Chris Piech.
* In this project, I focus on the sensing system, which allows us to track other cars based on noisy sensor readings.(Key words: Bayesian network basics, Emission probabilities, Transition probabilities, Particle filtering)
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project4_Cars/pj4.pdf) and my report [here](./Project4_Cars/Report.pdf)    

**FinalProject_GOMOKU**
* I do this project with [Ruipu Luo](https://rupertluo.github.io/)
* In this project, we design a fast and effective search algorithm for Gomoku playing.
* We use MCTS and Minimax search with $\alpha$-$\beta$ pruning algorithm for Gomoku and add the threat space algorithm to directly find those high-threat points in order to save search time. The  pruning  algorithm  can  reach  the  chess  power  of pisq7, which won the 24th place in the Gomoku AI Contest 2015.
* You can see the detail of project [here](./FinalProject_GOMOKU/Final_PJ.pdf) and my report [here](./FinalProject_GOMOKU/Alpha_Beta_Pruning_with_Thread_DetectionAlgorithm_for_Gomoku.pdf)
