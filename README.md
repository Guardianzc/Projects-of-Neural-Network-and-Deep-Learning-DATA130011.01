# Projects-of-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning-DATA130011.01
This is a report including all projects in my 2021 Spring Neural Network and Deep Learning course (DATA130011.01) in [School of Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/)  of [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) .
The project is mainly about the construction of neural networks.
## Project
   * [Lab1_Warmup](./Lab1)
   * [Project1_Handwritten digit classification](./Project1)
   * [Project2_CIFAR-10](./Project2)
   * [Project3_3D Object Classification](./Project4_Cars)
   * [FinalProject_GOMOKU](./FinalProject_GOMOKU)
   
## Details
**Lab1_Warmup**
* This lab aims to help the students refresh the basics of python, particularly, NumPy
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Lab1/Lab1.pdf) and my report [here](./Lab1/Report.pdf)
    
**Project1_Handwritten digit classification**
* In this project, we use MATLAB to achieve the basic methods and settings in neural network
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project1/project_1.pdf) and my report [here](./Project1/Report_钟诚_16307110259.pdf)

**Project2_CIFAR-10**
* Network needs to contain a lot of components. (e.g. 2D pooling layer, Drop out, Residual Connection) So it will improve the performance of the network on the CIFAR-10 dataset based on the ResNet-18 network.
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project2/Reference/project_2.pdf) and my report [here](./Project2/Report.pdf)
    
**Project3_Cars**
* In this project, you will try to use neural network to classify 3D point clouds,
and initially understand the use of 3D data and the application of deep learning
in the 3D field.
* In this project, I focus on the sensing system, which allows us to track other cars based on noisy sensor readings.(Key words: Bayesian network basics, Emission probabilities, Transition probabilities, Particle filtering)
* You can see the detail of project [here](./Project4_Cars/pj4.pdf) and my report [here](./Project4_Cars/Report.pdf)    

**FinalProject_GOMOKU**
* I do this project with [Ruipu Luo](https://rupertluo.github.io/)
* In this project, we design a fast and effective search algorithm for Gomoku playing.
* We use MCTS and Minimax search with $\alpha$-$\beta$ pruning algorithm for Gomoku and add the threat space algorithm to directly find those high-threat points in order to save search time. The  pruning  algorithm  can  reach  the  chess  power  of pisq7, which won the 24th place in the Gomoku AI Contest 2015.
* You can see the detail of project [here](./FinalProject_GOMOKU/Final_PJ.pdf) and my report [here](./FinalProject_GOMOKU/Alpha_Beta_Pruning_with_Thread_DetectionAlgorithm_for_Gomoku.pdf)
